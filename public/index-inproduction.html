                    During the 2020 HackOhio hackathon, I and two of my friends (Ebo Sompa Dennis and Gianna Torpey) created a software system for detecting
                    a select number of
                    objects using a laptop camera and notifying the user when an item in the list is found through a
                    text message and an IOS application.
                    This was built using openCv in python for parsing videodata gotten from the camera, twilio text
                    messaging api, firebase's firestore database and swiftUI for the mobile app.
                    It ended up winning 'most difficult hack', 'top ten hacks' and runner up for 'tech for social
                    justice.'

                <p>
                    In summer 2021, I created a grid-type fundraiser management + raffle generator website consisting of 100 user blocks for a
                    client using flutter for the frontend and firebase firestore for the backend. The most interesting
                    part of this was figuring out how to scroll all blocks together and not as one individual
                    row or column as flutter used controllers for each row/ column. Since this was a private project, I
                    cannot provide the source code but I have made a grid of what is looks like.

                    For my honors class on plastics in 2020, we were required to do a final project at the end of the class. Now, being a computer science student, I decided to build
                    a prototype website that could increase the interest people had in recycling by making the payments( .25cents per bottle) you are supposed to get for recycling easily accessible and trackable.
                     I ended up hacking at it and building the frontend with Html, css and vanilla javascript(does not look very great but..üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) and hosted it on firebase hosting.

                    During the 2018 Hack Ohio hackathon, I and a friend (Ebo Sompa Dennis) created a prototype in arduino of a dustbin that 
                    reminded users of the type of recycling trash they were about to dump trash in using an ultrasonic sensor, an LCD screen and a buzzer.  The purpose of this was to help reduce the amount of time and costs needed to filter recyclable trash when it is sent over to the recycling facility.
                    We did not win anything this time but I did learn a lot about using  arduino and
                     calculations needed for working with ultrasonic sensors.
